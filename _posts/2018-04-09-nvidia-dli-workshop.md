I am holding NVIDIA's first deep learning workshop in NUS :)

In this half-day Image Classification with DIGITS workshop, you will learn to
- leverage deep neural networks (DNN) within the deep learning workflow to solve a real-world image classification problem using NVIDIA DIGITS.
- walk through the process of data preparation, model definition, model training and troubleshooting
- use validation data to test and try different strategies for improving model performance using GPUs.
