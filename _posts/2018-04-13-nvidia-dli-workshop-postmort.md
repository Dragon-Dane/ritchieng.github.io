As you know, I held NUS' first NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Workshop. Feel free to follow our [NUS NVIDIA Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nus.nvidia/) page for more workshops!

In this half-day Image Classification with DIGITS workshop, participants learnt to
- leverage deep neural networks (DNN) within the deep learning workflow to solve a real-world image classification problem using NVIDIA DIGITS.
- walk through the process of data preparation, model definition, model training and troubleshooting
- use validation data to test and try different strategies for improving model performance using GPUs.

It was a full house! Here are some recap pictures taken by helpful NVIDIA student helpers.
