I am holding NVIDIA's second deep learning workshop in NUS after popular demand for the first one.

Many problems have established deep learning solutions, but sometimes the problem that you want to solve does not. Learn to create custom solutions through the challenge of detecting whale faces from aerial images by:
- Combining traditional computer vision with deep learning
- Performing minor “brain surgery” on an existing neural network using the deep learning framework Caffe
- Harnessing the knowledge of the deep learning community by identifying and using a purpose built network and end-to-end labeled data
