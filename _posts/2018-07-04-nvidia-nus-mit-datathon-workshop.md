I held NVIDIA's third deep learning workshop in NUS this year at the [NUS-NUHS-MIT-Datathon](http://www.nus-datathon.com/workshop)! It's amazing to see how deep learning is gaining traction in healthcare in Singapore. Fast forward 10 years and I see doctors working closely with deep learning algorithms.

Kudos to fellow people delivering the other 3 workshops: Prof Leo Celi (MIT) & Data Scientist team (MIT), Asst Prof Mengling 'Mornin' Feng (NUS), Dr Jason Pitt (CSI, NUS), and Dr Ngiam Kee Yuan (CTO, NUHS).
