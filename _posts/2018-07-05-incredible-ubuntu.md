When I created [The Incredible PyTorch](https://github.com/ritchieng/the-incredible-pytorch) to help people get started with PyTorch via examples across the community and it has grown to more than 2500+ stars and 450+ forks being used as a resource book. I decided to create a sister repository to help people complement their PyTorch journey on Ubuntu via easy-to-use commands.

This is a curated list of easy copy-paste commands to make your life easier by fixing common problems and enhance your programming environment in Ubuntu. I created it because it made my life easier, hope it helps!
