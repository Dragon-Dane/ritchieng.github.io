## Ritchie Ng

Hello, this is my personal Github page repository that has all my personal notes. It's served on [ritchieng.github.io](ritchieng.github.io) and [http://www.ritchieng.com/](ritchieng.github.io), both via Github page through this repository.

All the pages with notes are python notebooks where I appended my own notes previously to the materials from free deep learning courses online. I would like to thank Github Pages for serving these notebooks for free through this repository as it has helped many people in going through these free courses. And I would like to thank the authors that made these courses and materials available for free online.
