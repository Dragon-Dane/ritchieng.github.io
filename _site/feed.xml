            <title>To the future of AI in and beyond Africa</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/ritchieng/image/upload/v1542700156/ritchieng.com/ammi_facebook_google_2018/ammi_students_2018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helped to teach these students from The African Masters of Machine Intelligence (AMMI) by The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) with Alfredo Canziani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique pedagogy is required for deep learning beginning with intuition, culminating in just enough math, and ending with programming. This approached has worked when I delivered my deep learning course to over 3000 students over 120 countries. And I continue to champion this pedagogy. I‚Äôm very pleased that I share the same passion with Alfedo when he delivered his interactive lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, I see great potential when I personally interacted with students here. I see future deep learning researchers and applied machine intelligence experts who have the potential to make groundbreaking changes in the fields of healthcare, agriculture and education throughout Africa. With the right education, mentorship and opportunities, they would be pioneers. Simply put, deep learning talent is underexplored in this continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thankful to Alfredo Canziani who has been my best pal and inspirational guy while I was there, Moustapha Cisse for creating these opportunities for young African students to thrive, #Facebook and #Google for supporting this program, and Pedro Antonio Mart√≠nez Mediano and Marc Deisenroff. Coincidentally, I would also like to thank Yoshua Bengio for holding ICLR in Africa in 2020 for the first time that he announced recently. Finally, really appreciate how #PyTorch has made programming neural networks more approachable and it was made possible with the amazing PyTorch community sparked by Soumith Chintala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about community, I got to contribute to the deep learning community with the help from supportive groups and individuals from the global deep learning community. Likewise, we should continually help these young Africans like any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the future of AI in and beyond Africa. Looking forward to help Moustapha in any way I can to nurture AI talent üôÇ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm being a fanboy here, but Yann Lecun liked my post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ritchiengz/posts/2267714723302661&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
&lt;br /&gt;Ritchie&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Recap of 2018 NExT++ AI Workshop</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextcenter.org/event/next-workshop-2018-nanjing/&quot;&gt;NExT++‚Äôs 3rd Workshop&lt;/a&gt; and this time we are looking at the applications and development of AI related technologies in the healthcare and finance verticals with the theme ‚ÄúAI in Health and Finance‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual summary of my talk on AI and Unstructured Analytics in Fintech. Doesn‚Äôt contain everything, but whatever the non-technical designers could come up with in real-time. Really amazing so kudos to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really thankful to the whole team in my former lab, NExT++ and a close friend, Choon Meng, for making all the arrangements. Also thanks to Tek Min, Yi Hao and everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super happy to catch up with Prof Tat-Seng Chua (KITHCT Chair Professor at the School of Computing), Prof Sun Maosong (Dean of Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University), and Prof Dame Wendy Hall (Director of the Web Science Institute, University of Southampton).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>NVIDIA Object Detection with DIGITS 2018</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I am holding NVIDIA‚Äôs second deep learning workshop in NUS after popular demand for the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many problems have established deep learning solutions, but sometimes the problem that you want to solve does not. Learn to create custom solutions through the challenge of detecting whale faces from aerial images by:
- Combining traditional computer vision with deep learning
- Performing minor ‚Äúbrain surgery‚Äù on an existing neural network using the deep learning framework Caffe
- Harnessing the knowledge of the deep learning community by identifying and using a purpose built network and end-to-end labeled data&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>NVIDIA Image Classification with DIGITS 2018</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;As you know, I held NUS‚Äô first NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Workshop. Feel free to follow our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/nus.nvidia/&quot;&gt;NUS NVIDIA Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page for more workshops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this half-day Image Classification with DIGITS workshop, participants learnt to
- leverage deep neural networks (DNN) within the deep learning workflow to solve a real-world image classification problem using NVIDIA DIGITS.
- walk through the process of data preparation, model definition, model training and troubleshooting
- use validation data to test and try different strategies for improving model performance using GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a full house!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
