## Hello! 
Currently I am leading artificial intelligence with my colleagues in [ensemblecap.ai](https://ensemblecap.ai/), an AI hedge fund based in Singapore. I am also an [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute instructor](https://www.facebook.com/nus.nvidia/) enabling developers, data scientists, and researchers leverage on deep learning to solve the most challenging problems. Also, I'm into deep learning research with researchers based in [NExT++ (NUS) led by Chua Tat-Seng](http://www.nextcenter.org/) and [MILA led by Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/). 

My passion for enabling anyone to leverage on deep learning has led to the creation of [Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/) where I have taught and still continue to teach more than 2000 students in over 60 countries around the world. The course is recognized by [Soumith Chintala](https://pytorch.org/2018/01/19/a-year-in.html), Facebook AI Research, and [Alfredo Canziani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6407592585275142144), Post-Doctoral Associate under Yann Lecun, as the first comprehensive PyTorch Tutorial. 
 
I was previously conducting research in deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing in NExT Search Centre led by [Professor Tat-Seng Chua](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chuats/) that is jointly setup between National University of Singapore (NUS) and Tsinghua University and is part of [NUS Smart Systems Institute](http://ssi.nus.edu.sg/#homepage). During my time there, I managed to publish in top-tier conferences and workshops like ICML and IJCAI.

Oh yes! You can check out some of my cool stickman [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking to chill with my stickman.

## The Purpose of Artificial Intelligence
John Keynes predicted we would only work 15 hours a week. Yup, you heard it! I believe we can do that with even fewer stupendously productive hours. We can then spend the rest of our time doing other awesome things like [Black Water Rafting](http://www.waitomo.com/black-water-rafting/Pages/default.aspx). I bet you have never heard of that.

We can and will reach there by improving machine intelligence that can directly and indirectly improve people's lives.
