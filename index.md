## Hello! 
Currently I am leading artificial intelligence with my colleagues in [ensemblecap.ai](https://ensemblecap.ai/), an AI hedge fund based in Singapore comprising quants and traders from JPMorgan and Nomura. I have built the whole AI tech stack in a production environment with rigorous time-sensitive and fail-safe software testing powering multi-million dollar trades daily.

I am also an [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute instructor](https://www.facebook.com/nus.nvidia/) leading all deep learning workshops in NUS, Singapore and conducting workshops across Southeast Asia.

My passion for enabling anyone to leverage on deep learning has led to the creation of [Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/) where I have taught and still continue to teach more than 2000 students in over 60 countries around the world. The course is recognized by [Soumith Chintala](https://pytorch.org/2018/01/19/a-year-in.html), Facebook AI Research, and [Alfredo Canziani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6407592585275142144), Post-Doctoral Associate under Yann Lecun, as the first comprehensive PyTorch Tutorial. 

In my free time, I'm into deep learning research with researchers based in [NExT++ (NUS) led by Chua Tat-Seng](http://www.nextcenter.org/) and [MILA led by Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/). I was previously conducting research in meta-learning for hyperaparameter optimization for deep learning algorithms in NExT Search Centre that is jointly setup between National University of Singapore (NUS), Tsinghua University and University of Southampton led by co-directors [Prof Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) (KITHCT Chair Professor at the School of Computing), [Prof Sun Maosong](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224193416561782037/20101224193416561782037_.html) (Dean of Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University), and [Prof Dame Wendy Hall](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/wh) (Director of the Web Science Institute, University of Southampton). During my time there, I managed to publish in top-tier conferences and workshops like ICML and IJCAI.

I'm based in Singapore currently. Previously I was based in Seoul (South Korea), Indiana (USA), and Milan (Italy) for extended periods.

Oh yes! You can check out some of my cool stickman [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking to chill with my stickman.

## The Purpose of Artificial Intelligence
John Keynes predicted we would only work 15 hours a week. Yup, you heard it! I believe we can do that with even fewer stupendously productive hours. We can then spend the rest of our time doing other awesome things like [Black Water Rafting](http://www.waitomo.com/black-water-rafting/Pages/default.aspx). I bet you have never heard of that.

We can and will reach there by improving machine intelligence that can directly and indirectly improve people's lives.
